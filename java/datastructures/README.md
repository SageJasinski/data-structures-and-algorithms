# Data Structures

## Implementation Notes

## Code Challenges

# Singly Linked List
linked lists and node class added to datat structure folder in java-linked lists

## Challenge
Make a linked list and add an insert,includes, and toString method which will add,search, and stringify elements in the linked list respectively.

## Approach & Efficiency
 too the methods and tested them against paramenter I created in the test section to make sure they outputed the proper values. The longest time efficency is the stringify method as it has a BigO of n due to it re writing all nodes as strings so it has to loop through the List.
