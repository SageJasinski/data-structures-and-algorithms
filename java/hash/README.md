# Hashtables
Implement the set, get,has,and keys methods for a hashtable

## Challenge
Implement the set, get,has,and keys methods for a hashtable

## Approach & Efficiency
for the set method I "put" the given key and value into the hashtable with the built in method by referencing the hashtable. The put method will map the given key and value in the hashtable.
for the get methode I referenced the get method on our hashtable which given a key, if that key equals a key we have stored in our hashtable, will return the value associated to that key.
for the has method I took the hashtable and called the contains key method on it which will return true if the provided key is equal to a key in out hash table.
for the keys method i was stumped as I thought the idea of using a hashtable was so you didn't have indexes for a faster look up time.
I chose these methods as they are objectively the fastest and most reliable way to construct, call, and get hashes and hashtable in java and many other languages.

## API
No api was harmed during the making of these methods.
