# Stacks and Queues
Psuedoque with two stacks

## Challenge
Using two stacks create a que which follows the first in first out rule.

## Approach & Efficiency
We can denote one stack as out input stack where we can place all our values and the second stack as an output stack which we
will push values into and that will naturally rearragne the order in the output stack to be first in first out.
